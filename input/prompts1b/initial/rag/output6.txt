To properly place all the values from the bytestream into the Initial Packet structure, we need to parse the bytestream according to the QUIC Initial Packet format. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Header Form (1 bit)**: 
   - From the bytestream, the first byte is `c8`.
   - `c8` in binary is `11001000`.
   - The first bit (`1`) indicates that it is a Long Header packet, specifically an Initial Packet.
   
2. **Fixed Bit (1 bit)**:
   - The second bit is `1`, which is consistent with the requirement.
   
3. **Long Packet Type (2 bits)**:
   - The next two bits are `00`, indicating it is an Initial Packet (as per the QUIC standard).
  
4. **Reserved Bits (2 bits)**:
   - The next two bits are `00`.

5. **Packet Number Length (2 bits)**:
   - The final two bits of the first byte are `10` which indicates a Packet Number Length of 2 bytes.

6. **Version (32 bits)**:
   - The next four bytes after the header byte are `00 00 00 01`.

7. **Destination Connection ID Length (8 bits)**:
   - The next byte is `08`, indicating the length of the Destination Connection ID is 8 bytes.

8. **Destination Connection ID (0..160 bits)**:
   - The following 8 bytes are `1d 5b 03 80 bd 0c 39 07`.

9. **Source Connection ID Length (8 bits)**:
   - The next byte is `08`, indicating the length for the Source Connection ID is 8 bytes as well.

10. **Source Connection ID (0..160 bits)**:
    - The next 8 bytes are `08 a5 c5 2d 7c f9 d0 8f`.

11. **Token Length (i)**:
    - The next byte is `7b`, indicating a length of 123 bytes.

12. **Token (..)**:
    - The next 123 bytes starting from `0044e6eba63a0a19ee0c...` (123 bytes worth).

13. **Length (i)**:
    - Immediately following the token would be the Length field. In this example, it is `f0`, indicating a length.
  
14. **Packet Number (8..32 bits)**:
    - Given the Packet Number Length is 2 bytes (`0021`). 

15. **Packet Payload (8..)**:
    - The remaining portion is `14 95 45 61 20 b5...`.

Based on this explanation, the values placed correctly into the Initial Packet look like this:
