```
Line 1: c8
Line 2: c2
Missing packets:
Initial: c300000001080d3adc0fd41bfa1a08ca30a3e84e3f12db401041616c7068616e756d1a5b0308000000000175. Line 3: e2
```

Note: In the solution, we identified that the initial packet is missing after Line 2 and provided a valid hex string for it. The correct packet header for this type of packet is `c3`.
