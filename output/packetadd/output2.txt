Given the bytestream e800000001081d5b0380bd0c390708a3507dc3a212c5e6401acfeb7ca8acdfd13ffe086c5264f308a13e6b3e5c71b5b7c1c5ac, we can extract the fields based on the grammar provided for the QUIC packet.

1. Header Form (1) = 0x1 (e8)
2. Fixed Bit (1) = 0x1 (00)
3. Long Packet Type (2) = 0x0 (00)
4. Version (32) = 0x00000108 (00000001)
5. Destination Connection ID Length (8) = 0x1d (1d)
6. Destination Connection ID (0..160) = 0x5b0380bd0c390708a3507dc3a212c5e6401acfeb7ca8acdfd13ffe086c5264f308a13e6b3e5c71b5b7c1c5ac
7. Source Connection ID Length (8) = 0x0 (00)
8. Source Connection ID (0..160) = N/A (not present in the bytestream)

Therefore, the extracted fields from the bytestream are as follows:
- Header Form: 0x1
- Fixed Bit: 0x1
- Long Packet Type: 0x0
- Version: 0x00000108
- Destination Connection ID Length: 0x1d
- Destination Connection ID: 0x5b0380bd0c390708a3507dc3a212c5e6401acfeb7ca8acdfd13ffe086c5264f308a13e6b3e5c71b5b7c1c5ac
