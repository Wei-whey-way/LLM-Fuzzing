First, we need to break down the bytestream into individual fields according to the QUIC packet grammar specified in RFC 9000:

1. Fixed Bit (1 bit):
   - e8 (in binary: 11101000)
   - This indicates a long header packet.

2. Packet Type (7 bits):
   - 00 (in binary: 0000000)
   - This indicates a Version Negotiation packet.

3. Version (32 bits):
   - 00000001 (in hexadecimal: 01)
   - This is the version field.

4. Destination Connection ID Length (8 bits):
   - 08 (in hexadecimal: 08)
   - This indicates the length of the Destination Connection ID field.

5. Destination Connection ID (variable length based on the previous field):
   - 1d5b0380bd0c3907 (hexadecimal)

6. Source Connection ID Length (8 bits):
   - 08 (in hexadecimal: 08)
   - This indicates the length of the Source Connection ID field.

7. Source Connection ID (variable length based on the previous field):
   - 08a3507dc3a212c5 (hexadecimal)

8. Supported Version (32 bits):
   - e6401acfeb7ca8acdfd13ffe086c5264 (hexadecimal)

9. Supported Version (32 bits):
   - f308a13e6b3e5c71b5b7c1c5ac (hexadecimal)

After extracting each field from the bytestream based on the QUIC packet grammar, we have successfully broken down the provided bytestream.
